# Get the initial compartment state

Get the initial compartment state

## Usage

``` r
u0(object, ...)

# S4 method for class 'SimInf_model'
u0(object, ...)

# S4 method for class 'SimInf_individual_events'
u0(object, time = NULL, target = NULL, age = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  The object to get the initial compartment state `u0` from.

- ...:

  Additional arguments.

- time:

  Only used when object is of class `SimInf_individual_events` object.
  The time-point that will be used to create u0. If left empty (the
  default), the earliest time among the events will be used.

- target:

  Only used when object is of class `SimInf_individual_events` object.
  The SimInf model ('SEIR', 'SIR', 'SIS', 'SISe3', 'SISe3_sp', 'SISe',
  or 'SISe_sp') to target the events and u0 for. The default, `NULL`,
  creates an `u0`, but where the compartments might have to be renamed
  and post-processed to fit the specific use case.

- age:

  Only used when object is of class `SimInf_individual_events` object.
  An integer vector with break points in days for the ageing events. The
  default, `NULL`, creates an `u0` where all individuals belong to the
  same age category.

## Value

a `data.frame` with the initial compartment state.

## Examples

``` r
## Create an SIR model object.
model <- SIR(u0 = data.frame(S = 99, I = 1, R = 0),
             tspan = 1:100,
             beta = 0.16,
             gamma = 0.077)

## Get the initial compartment state.
u0(model)
#>    S I R
#> 1 99 1 0
```
