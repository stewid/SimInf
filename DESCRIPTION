Description: Livestock movements are important for the spread of many
    infectious diseases between herds. The package provides an
    efficient and flexible framework for stochastic disease spread
    modelling that integrates within-herd disease dynamics as
    continuous-time Markov chains and livestock movements between
    herds as scheduled events. The core simulation solver is
    implemented in C and uses 'OpenMP' (if available) to divide work
    over multiple processors. The package contains template models and
    can be extended with user defined models.
