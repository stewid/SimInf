SimInf 2.0.0.9000
-----------------

NEW FEATURES

* Two new built-in models: 'SIR' and 'SEIR'.

CHANGES

* Removed the sub-domain argument. Instead use the local data vector
  'ldata' to pass node specific data.

* Removed the unused parameter 'epsilon' from the 'SISe_sp' and
   'SISe3_sp' models.

* Refactoring of local spread in the 'SISe_sp' and 'SISe3_sp' models.

* Added a parameter with a pointer to a random number generator to the
  post time step function.

SimInf 2.0.0
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Two new built-in models: 'SISe_sp' and 'SISe3_sp' with spatial
  coupling.

* Added the 'run_outer' method to run a model on scaled 'gdata'
  parameters.

IMPROVEMENTS

* Added two synthetic datasets 'u0_SISe3' and 'events_SISe3' to
  demonstrate how to use SimInf.

* Several improvements to the documentation.

* Added summary method to the siminf_model class and the
  scheduled_events class.

CHANGES

* The slot N in scheduled_events is changed from dgCMatrix to matrix.

* Refactoring of the 'show' method for the siminf_model class and the
  scheduled_events class.

* Renamed function prototype 'PostTimeStepFun' to 'PTSFun' and
  'PropensityFun' to 'TRFun'.

* Renamed 'init' argument to 'u0' in the 'SISe' and 'SISe3' methods.

* Changed 'node', 'dest', 'select' and 'shift' to one-based indices in
  'scheduled_events'.

BUG FIXES

* Changed to use 'gsl_rng_uniform_pos' instead of 'gsl_rng_uniform' to
  avoid 0 in the direct SSA. If zero was randomly selected and the
  first compartment empty, the simulator could enter a negative state.

SimInf 1.0.0
------------

* First release.
