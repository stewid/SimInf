\section{Introduction}

Livestock movements are an important transmission route for many
infectious diseases and can transfer infectious individuals between
holdings over large distances \citep{Danon2011}.  The livestock
movements between holdings can be represented as a temporal network
with nodes coupled by directed edges and the time when each edge was
active \citep{Holme2012}.  The temporal network of livestock movements
forms a complex dynamic system in the topology, connectivity and
intensity \citep{Bajardi2011, Dutta2014}, and these properties affect
how various diseases spread in a network \citep{Shirley2005,
  Buettner2014}.  European Union legislation requires member states to
keep a registry of all bovine animals in national databases
\citep{EC-No-1760-2000, EC-No-911-2004}, which makes it possible to
use real data for the time-varying contact network and the population
demographics for large scale disease spread simulations, to better
understand transmission and explore control strategies.  However,
incorporating large amount of network data in simulations is
computationally challenging and require efficient algorithms.
Furthermore, specifying realistic models for disease transmission is a
complicated process since various diseases have fundamentally
different transmission routes. Compare, for example, fecal-oral
pathogens with indirect transmission routes via the environment with
infections that are transferred by direct contact between individuals
\citep{BrooksPollock2014}.

In this work, we present an efficient and flexible framework for
data-driven spatio-temporal disease spread modeling, designed to
efficiently incorporate large volumes of population demographics and
temporal network data.  This allows the user to asses the spread of,
for example, endemic diseases in the cattle population, in national
scale simulations \citep{Bauer2016}.  We have developed the
\proglang{R} \citep{R} package \pkg{SimInf}, a discrete-event
simulator that divides work among multiple processors available in
standard computers.  The model integrates infection dynamics as
continuous-time Markov chains and available data such as animal
movements, births, slaughter or aging are incorporated as scheduled
events.  One of our design goal was to make \pkg{SimInf} completely
extendable and allow for growth in available models and specialized
solvers through contributions from the community.  Using compiled
\proglang{C} code, rather than interpreted \proglang{R} code, for the
transition-rate functions ensures maximum efficiency when simulating
the model.  To simplify the process of generating the required
\proglang{C} code for models, the \pkg{SimInf} package include
functionality to automatically create \proglang{C} code from a model
specification.

There exists several related \proglang{R} packages for epidemiological
modeling on the Comprehensive \proglang{R} Archive Network (CRAN) that
we would like to mention here.  The package \pkg{amei} \citep{amei} is
designed for parameter estimation of epidemic models and finding
optimal intervention strategies, for example, vaccination, to control
disease spread.  Another package is \pkg{surveillance}, a framework
for monitoring, modeling, and regression analysis of infectious
diseases, \citep{surveillance}.  \pkg{EpiModel} \citep{EpiModel} is an
\proglang{R} package that, similar to \pkg{SimInf}, includes a
framework for modeling spread of diseases on networks.  However, they
differ in how the data is generated for the modeling: the network data
in \pkg{EpiModel} is simulated using \pkg{statnet} \citep{statnet},
while \pkg{SimInf} was designed to incorporate available network data.
The are also similarities between the \proglang{R} package
\pkg{GillespieSSA} \citep{Pineda-Krch2008} and \pkg{SimInf}, in that
both uses the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA)
\citep{Gillespie1977}.  However, for computational efficiency, the
algorithm is implemented using \proglang{C} code in \pkg{SimInf}.

The paper is organized as follows.  In \S\ref{sec:modeling} we
summarize the mathematical foundation for our framework.  Section
\S\ref{sec:framework} gives a technical description of the simulation
framework.  In \S\ref{sec:examples} we illustrate the use of the
package by some worked examples.  Finally, in \S\ref{sec:extend} we
demonstrate how to extend \pkg{SimInf} with user-defined models.

\section{Epidemiological modeling}
\label{sec:modeling}

In the following section we give a brief overview of the
epidemiological modeling framework employed in \pkg{SimInf}. The
overall approach consists of continuous-time Markov chains as a
general model of the dynamics of the epidemiological
state. Importantly, we also allow for a coupling with concentration
variables obeying ordinary differential equations (ODEs), as well as
to externally defined events. We draw much of the material here from
\citep{Bauer2016, siminf_Ch}.

In \S\ref{subsec:local}--\ref{subsec:global} below we distinguish
between the \emph{local} dynamics that describes the evolution of the
epidemiological state at a single node, and the \emph{global}
dynamics, which describes the system at the network level. The overall
numerical approach underlying \pkg{SimInf} is described in
\S\ref{subsec:numerics}.

    infected and $2$--$4$ are non-infected nodes.  Arrows indicate
    animal movements from a source node to a destination node, where
    labels denote the size of the shipment.  In this example,
    infection may spread by livestock movements from $1$ to $3$ at
    $t=2$ (indicated by blue lines in node $3$ at $t=3$) and then from
    $3$ to $2$ at $t=3$.  (b) The livestock movements represented as
    events $(\mathit{source}, \mathit{destination}, t, n)$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Local dynamics}
\label{subsec:local}

We describe the state of a single node with a \emph{state vector}
$X(t) \in \Intdom_{+}^{\Ncompartments}$, which counts the number of
individuals at each of $\Ncompartments$ compartments at time $t$. The
transitions between these compartments are stochastic and are
described by the transition matrix $\Stoich \in
\Intdom^{\Ncompartments \times \Ntransitions}$ and the transition
intensities $R: \Intdom_{+}^{\Ncompartments} \to
\Realdom_{+}^{\Ntransitions}$, assuming $\Ntransitions$ different
transitions. We then form a \textit{random counting measure}
$\mu_{k}(dt) = \mu(R_{k}(X(t-)); \, dt)$ that is associated with a
Poisson process for the $k$th intensity $R_{k}(X(t-)$, which in turn
depends on the state prior to any transition at time $t$, that is,
$X(t-)$.

The local dynamics can then compactly be described by a pure jump
stochastic differential equation (SDE),
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:vectorJSDE}
  dX(t) &= \Stoich\fatmu(dt),
\end{align}
where $\fatmu(dt)$ is a vector measure built up from the scalar
counting measures $\fatmu(dt) = [\mu_{1}(dt),\ldots,$
  $\mu_{\Ntransitions}(dt)]^\top$. If at time $t$, transition $k$
occurs, then the state vector is updated according to
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:eventupdate}
   X(t)=X(t-)+\Stoich_k,
\end{align}
with $\Stoich_k$ the $k$th column of $\Stoich$. In
\eqref{eq:vectorJSDE} the $\Ntransitions$ different epidemiological
state transitions are competing in the sense of independent Poisson
processes. The `winning' process decides what event happens and
changes the state according to \eqref{eq:eventupdate}. The simulation
then proceeds under the Markov assumption where previous events are
remembered via the state variable $X$ only.

To make this abstract notation a bit more concrete we consider a
traditional example as follows. In an SIS-model the transitions
between a susceptible and an infected compartment can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:sirtrans}
  &\left. \begin{array}{rl}
    S+I &\xrightarrow{\beta} 2I \\
    I &\xrightarrow{\gamma} S \\
  \end{array} \right\}.
  \intertext{With a state vector consisting of two compartments $X =
    [\#S,\#I]$, i.e., the number of susceptible and infected
    individuals, respectively, we can then write the transition matrix
    and intensity vector as}
  \label{eq:SIRstoich}
    \Stoich &= \left[ \begin{array}{rr}
        -1 & 1 \\
        1  & -1
      \end{array} \right], \\
    R(x) &= [\beta x_{1}x_{2},\gamma x_{2}]^\top.
\end{align}
To connect this with traditional ODE-based models, note that,
replacing the random measure in \eqref{eq:vectorJSDE} with its mean
drift, we arrive at
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ODE}
  \frac{dx(t)}{dt} &= \Stoich R(x),
\end{align}
where now the state variable $x \in \Realdom^{\Ncompartments}$. The
differences between \eqref{eq:vectorJSDE} and \eqref{eq:ODE} are that
the randomness and discreteness of the state variable are not present
in the latter formulation. If these features are thought to be
important, then \eqref{eq:vectorJSDE} is an accurate stochastic
alternative to \eqref{eq:ODE}, relying only on the Markovian
``memoryless'' assumption.

There are, however, situations where we would like to mix the discrete
stochastic model with a concentration-type ODE model. In a multi-scale
description there are typically variables for which a continuous
description is more natural: a typical example is the concentration of
bacteria in an infectious environment for which individual counting
would clearly not be feasible.

Assuming an additional concentration state vector $Y \in
\Realdom^{\Nconcentrations}$ a general model which augments
\eqref{eq:vectorJSDE} is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:JSDE_ODE}
  \left. \begin{array}{rcl}
    dX(t) &=& \Stoich\fatmu(dt) \\
    Y'(t) &=& f(X(t-),Y(t)) \\
  \end{array} \right\},
\end{align}
where now the random measure depends also on the concentration
variable,
\begin{align}
  \fatmu(dt) = \fatmu(R(X(t-),Y(t)),dt).
\end{align}
The overall combined state vector is then $[X; \; Y] \in
[\Intdom^{\Ncompartments}; \; \Realdom^{\Nconcentrations}]$.

\subsection{Global dynamics}
\label{subsec:global}

To extend the local dynamics to a network model consisting of
$\Nnodes$ nodes we first define the overall state matrices $\X \in
\Intdom_{+}^{\Ncompartments \times \Nnodes}$ and $\Y \in
\Realdom^{\Nconcentrations \times \Nnodes}$ and then extend
\eqref{eq:JSDE_ODE} to
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:local1}
  d\X^{(i)}(t) &= \Stoich\fatmu^{(i)}(dt), \\
  \label{eq:local2}
  \frac{d\Y^{(i)}(t)}{dt} &= f(\X^{(i)},\Y^{(i)}),
\end{align}
where $i \in \{1,...,\Nnodes\}$ is the node index.

We then consider the $\Nnodes$ nodes being the vertices of an
undirected graph $\mathcal{G}$ with interactions defined in terms of
the counting measures $\fatnu^{(i,j)}$ and $\fatnu^{(j,i)}$. Here
$\fatnu^{(i,j)}$ represents the state changes due to an inflow of
individuals from node $i$ to node $j$, and $\fatnu^{(j,i)}$ represents
an inflow of individuals from node $j$ to node $i$, assuming node $j$
being in the connected component $C(i)$ of node $i$, and vice versa.

The network dynamics is then written as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:global1}
  d\X^{(i)}_{t} &= -\sum_{j \in C(i)} \Connect\fatnu^{(i,j)}(dt)+
  \sum_{j; \, i \in C(j)} \Connect\fatnu^{(j,i)}(dt), \\
  \label{eq:global2}
  \frac{d\Y^{(i)}(t)}{dt} &= -\sum_{j \in C(i)} g(\X^{(i)},\Y^{(i)})+
  \sum_{j; \, i \in C(j)} g(\X^{(j)},\Y^{(j)}).
\end{align}
In \eqref{eq:global2}, $g$ is similarly the ``flow'' of the
concentration variable $\Y$ between the nodes in the network. For
example, this could be the natural modeling target for concentration
variables $\Y$ which are transported via surface water or air.

Combining this with \eqref{eq:local1}--\eqref{eq:local2} we obtain the
overall dynamics
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:master1}
  d\X^{(i)}(t) &= \Stoich\fatmu^{(i)}(dt)-
  \sum_{j \in C(i)} \Connect\fatnu^{(i,j)}(dt)+
  \sum_{j; \, i \in C(j)} \Connect\fatnu^{(j,i)}(dt), \\
  \label{eq:master2}
  \frac{d\Y^{(i)}(t)}{dt} &= f(\X^{(i)},\Y^{(i)})-
  \sum_{j \in C(i)} g(\X^{(i)},\Y^{(i)})+
  \sum_{j; \, i \in C(j)} g(\X^{(j)},\Y^{(j)}).
\end{align}

Note that $\fatnu^{(i,j)}$ and $\fatnu^{(j,i)}$ may be equivalently
employed for externally scheduled events given by data using an
equivalent construction in terms of Dirac measures. This is the case,
for example, when intra-nodal transport data of individuals are
available.

\subsection{Numerical method}
\label{subsec:numerics}

In \pkg{SimInf}, we solve \eqref{eq:master1}--\eqref{eq:master2} by
splitting the local update scheme \eqref{eq:local1}--\eqref{eq:local2}
from the global update scheme
\eqref{eq:global1}--\eqref{eq:global2}. We discretize time as $0 =
t_{0} < t_{1} < t_2 < \cdots$, which is partially required as external
data has to be incorporated at some finitely resolved time stamps. The
numerical method of \pkg{SimInf} can then be written per node $i$ as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:numstep1}
  \tilde{\X}_{n+1}^{(i)} &= \X_{n}^{(i)} + \int^{t_{n+1}}_{t_n}
  \Stoich \fatmu^{(i)}(ds), \\
  \label{eq:numstep2}
  \X_{n+1}^{(i)} &= \tilde{\X}^{(i)}_{n+1}-\int^{t_{n+1}}_{t_n} \sum_{j \in C(i)}
  \Connect\fatnu^{(i,j)}(ds)+\int^{t_{n+1}}_{t_n} \sum_{j; \, i \in C(j)}
  \Connect\fatnu^{(j,i)}(ds), \\
  \label{eq:numstep3}
  \Y_{n+1}^{(i)} &= \Y_{n}^{(i)} + f(\tilde{\X}_{n+1}^{(i)},
  \Y_{n}^{(i)}) \, \Delta t_{n} \\
  \nonumber
  &\phantom{=}
  -\sum_{j \in C(i)} g(\tilde{\X}_{n+1}^{(i)},\Y_{n}^{(i)})\Delta t_{n}+
  \sum_{j; \, i \in C(j)} g(\tilde{\X}_{n+1}^{(j)},\Y_{n}^{(j)})\Delta t_{n}.
\end{align}

In this scheme, \eqref{eq:numstep1} forms the local stochastic step,
that is in practice simulated by the Gillespie method
\citep{Gillespie1977}. Equation~\ref{eq:numstep2} is the data step,
where externally scheduled events are incorporated. Note that the
stochastic step evolves at continuous time increments in the interval
$[t_n,t_{n+1}]$, and the data step operates only on the final state
$\tilde{\X}$ at $t_{n+1}$. The final step \eqref{eq:numstep3} is just
the Euler forward method in time with time-step $\Delta t_{n} =
t_{n+1}-t_{n}$ for the concentration variable $\Y$.

\section{Technical description of the simulation framework}
\label{sec:framework}

The overall design of \pkg{SimInf} was inspired and partly adapted
from the Unstructured Mesh Reaction-Diffusion Master Equation (URDME)
framework \citep{Engblom2009, Drawert2012}.  \pkg{SimInf} is a general
software framework for data-driven modeling and simulation of
stochastic disease-spread in a temporal network of connected nodes.
In particular, the transition rates and the transition topology are
specified using a compiled language \proglang{C} and \proglang{R}
matrices, respectively.  The overall modular design makes extensions
easy to handle and since the simulation engine is written in a
compiled language, the efficiency of the simulator is very high.

The most recent stable version of \pkg{SimInf} is distributed via CRAN
(\url{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SimInf}) and may, depending
on your platform, be available in source form or compiled binary form.
The development version is available on GitHub
(\url{https://github.com/stewid/SimInf}).  A binary form of
\pkg{SimInf} for macOS or Windows can be installed directly from CRAN.
However, if you install \pkg{SimInf} from source (from CRAN or a
\code{.tar.gz} file), the installation process requires a \proglang{C}
compiler, and that the GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
\citep{Gallassi2009} is installed on your system and is in the path.
Note that GSL (\url{https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/}) is not an
\proglang{R} add-on package, but needs to be installed separately, for
example, from a terminal using: \code{'sudo apt-get install
  libgsl0-dev'} on Debian and Ubuntu, \code{'sudo yum install
  gsl-devel'} on Fedora, CentOS or RHEL, or \code{'brew install gsl'}
on macOS with the Homebrew package manager.  Furthermore, when you
install \pkg{SimInf} from source, depending on features of the
compiler, the package is compiled with support for \proglang{OpenMP}
\citep{OpenMP2008} to divide work over multiple processors and perform
computations in parallel.  To find out more about installing
\proglang{R} add-on packages in general, the \texttt{'R Installation
  and Administration'} (\url{https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html})
manual describes the process in detail.  After installing the package

<<install-SimInf, eval=FALSE>>=
install.packages("SimInf")
@

it is loaded in \proglang{R} with the following command

<<load-SimInf>>=
library("SimInf")
@

\subsection{Overview}

The \pkg{SimInf} \proglang{R} package uses object oriented programming
with \code{S4} classes \citep{Chambers2008} to define objects with
logical layers connected by well-defined interfaces for different
modeling scenarios.  The two \code{S4} classes \code{SimInf\_model}
and \code{SimInf\_events} are central and provide the basis for the
flexible framework to perform efficient simulations in compiled
\proglang{C} code of the predefined models in \pkg{SimInf} or
user-defined models.  The \code{SimInf\_model} class contains slots
(Table~\ref{table:SimInf:model}) to data structures that define the
disease-spread model and one slot \code{events} associated to a
\code{SimInf\_events} object, which contains slots
(Table~\ref{table:scheduled:events}) to incorporate and process
scheduled events.  Furthermore, the \code{SimInf\_model} object also
contains the output trajectory after running the core simulation
solver on the disease-spread model.

All disease-spread models in \pkg{SimInf} contains the \code{S4} class
\code{SimInf\_model}.  Moreover, the predefined disease-spread models
in \pkg{SimInf} have a generating function \citep{Chambers2008}, with
the same name as the model, which check parameters and initialize the
necessary data structures for that specific model.  After the model is
initialized, the simulation is started with a call to the \code{run}
method.  To facilitate post-processing and visualization of output
data, the predefined models in \pkg{SimInf} provide several utility
functions, for example, \code{trajectory}, \code{prevalence} and
\code{plot}.

\subsection{Specification of an epidemiological model}
\label{sec:model}

The within-node disease spread model in \pkg{SimInf} is specified as a
compartment model with the individuals divided into compartments
defined by discrete disease statuses.  The model is defined by the
slots in the \code{S4} class \code{SimInf\_model}
(Table~\ref{table:SimInf:model}).  The compartments contains the
number of individuals in each of the $\Ncompartments$ disease states
in every $\Nnodes$ nodes.

Equation~\ref{eq:numstep3}, the stochastic step, contains
$\Ntransitions$ state transitions and is processed using the two
slots, \code{S} and \code{G}.  The \code{S} slot is the state-change
matrix ($\Ncompartments \times \Ntransitions$) that determines how to
change the number of individuals in the compartments of a node when
the $j^{th}$ state transition occurs, where $1 \le j \le
\Ntransitions$.  Each row corresponds to one compartment and each
column to a state transition.  Let \code{u[, i]} be the number of
individuals in each compartment in node $i$ at time $t_i$.  To move
simulation time forward in node $i$ to $t_i = t_i + \tau_i$, the
vector \code{u[, i]} is updated according to the $j^{th}$ transition
by adding the state-change vector \code{S[, j]} to \code{u[, i]}.
After updating \code{u[, i]}, the transition rates must be
recalculated to obtain the time to the next event.  However, a state
transition might not need all transition rates to be recalculated.
The dependency graph \code{G} is a matrix ($\Ntransitions \times
\Ntransitions$) that determines which transition rates that need to be
recalculated.  A non-zero entry in element \code{G[k, j]} indicates
that transition rate \code{k} needs to be recalculated if the $j^{th}$
state transition occurs, where \mbox{$1 \le$ \code{k} $\le
  \Ntransitions$}.  Furthermore, the final step \eqref{eq:numstep3} is
incorporated using a model specific post time step callback to allow
update of the concentration variable $\Y$.

\begin{table}[!ht]
  \small
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X}
    \toprule Slot & Description\\ \midrule

    \code{E} & Each row corresponds to one compartment in the model.
    The non-zero entries in a column indicate which compartments to
    sample individuals from when processing an event.  Which column to
    use for each event is specified by the \code{select} vector (see
    below).  \code{E} is a sparse matrix of class \code{dgCMatrix}.\\

    \code{N} & Determines how individuals in \textit{internal
      transfer} and \textit{external transfer} events are shifted to
    enter another compartment.  Each row corresponds to one
    compartment in the model.  The values in a column are added to the
    current compartment of sampled individuals to specify the
    destination compartment, for example, a value of \code{1} in an
    entry means that sampled individuals in this compartment are moved
    to the next compartment.  Which column to use for each event is
    specified by the \code{shift} vector (see below).  \code{N} is an
    integer matrix.\\

    \code{event} & Four event types are supported by the current
    solvers: \textit{exit}, \textit{enter}, \textit{internal
      transfer}, and \textit{external transfer}.  When assigning the
    events from a \code{data.frame}, they can either be coded as a
    numerical value or a character string: \textit{exit;} \code{0} or
    \code{'exit'}, \textit{enter;} \code{1} or \code{'enter'},
    \textit{internal transfer;} \code{2} or \code{'intTrans'}, and
    \textit{external transfer;} \code{3} or \code{'extTrans'}.
    Internally in \pkg{SimInf}, the event type is coded as a numerical
    value.\\

    \code{time} & Time of when the event occurs i.e., the event is
    processed when time is reached in the simulation.  \code{time} is
    an integer vector.\\

    \code{node} & The node that the event operates on.  Also the
    source node for an \textit{external transfer} event.  \code{node}
    is an integer vector, where $1 \le$ \code{node[i]} $\le
    \Nnodes$.\\

    \code{dest} & The destination node for an \textit{external
      transfer} event i.e., individuals are moved from \code{node} to
    \code{dest}, where $1 \le$ \code{dest[i]} $\le \Nnodes$.  Set
    \code{event = 0} for the other event types.  \code{dest} is an
    integer vector.\\

    \code{n} & The number of individuals affected by the event.
    \code{n} is an integer vector, where \code{n[i]} $\ge 0$.\\

    \code{proportion} & If \code{n[i]} equals zero, the number of
    individuals affected by \code{event[i]} is calculated by summing
    the number of individuals in the compartments determined by
    \code{select[i]} and multiplying with \code{proportion[i]}.
    \code{proportion} is a numeric vector, where $0 \le$
    \code{proportion[i]} $\le 1$.\\

    \code{select} & To process an \code{event[i]}, the compartments
    affected by the event are specified with \code{select[i]} together
    with the matrix \code{E}, where \code{select[i]} determines which
    column in \code{E} to use.  The specific individuals affected by
    the event are proportionally sampled from the compartments
    corresponding to the non-zero entries in the specified column in
    \code{E[, select[i]]}, where \code{select} is an integer vector.\\

    \code{shift} & Determines how individuals in \textit{internal
      transfer} and \textit{external transfer} events are shifted to
    enter another compartment.  The sampled individuals are shifted
    according to column \code{shift[i]} in matrix \code{N} i.e.,
    \code{N[, shift[i]]}, where \code{shift} is an integer vector.
    See above for a description of \code{N}.\\

  \label{table:scheduled:events}
\end{table}

Model-specific data that is passed to the transition-rate functions
and the post time-step function are stored in the two slots:
\code{ldata} and \code{gdata} in the \code{SimInf\_model} object.  The
\code{ldata} matrix holds local data for each node where \code{ldata[,
    i]} is the data vector for node $i$.  Data that is global, i.e.,
shared between nodes, is stored in the \code{gdata} vector.

The \code{events} slot in the \code{SimInf\_model} holds data to
process the scheduled events, further described in \S\ref{sec:events}.

During simulation of one trajectory, the state of the system is
written to the two matrices \code{U} and \code{V}.  This happens at
each occasion the simulation time passes a time point in \code{tspan},
a vector of increasing time points.  The first and last element in
\code{tspan} determines the start- and end-point of the simulation.
The column \code{U[, m]} contains the number of individuals in each
compartment in every node at \code{tspan[m]}, where $1 \le$ \code{m}
$\le$ \code{length(tspan)}.  The first $\Ncompartments$ rows in
\code{U} contains the compartments of the first node.  The next
$\Ncompartments$ rows contains the compartments of the second node
etc.  The \code{V} matrix contains output from continuous state
variables.  The column \code{V[, m]} contains the values at
\code{tspan[m]}.  The rows are grouped per node and the number of rows
per node is determined by the number of continuous state variables in
that specific model.  It is also possible to configure the simulator
to write the state of the system to the sparse matrices
\code{U\_sparse} and \code{V\_sparse}, which can save a lot of memory
if the model contains many nodes and time-points, but where only a few
of the data points are of interest.  In order to use this feature,
call the \code{U} and \code{V} methods (before running a trajectory)
with a \code{data.frame} that specify the nodes, time-points and
compartments where the simulator should write the state of the system.
The initial state in each node is specified by the two matrices
\code{u0} and \code{v0} where \code{u0[, i]} is the initial number of
individuals in each compartment at node $i$ and \code{v0[, i]} is the
initial continuous state in node $i$.

\subsection{Specification of scheduled events}
\label{sec:events}

The scheduled events are used to modify the discrete state of
individuals in a node at a pre-defined time $t$.  There are four
different types of events; \textit{enter}, \textit{internal transfer},
\textit{external transfer} and \textit{exit}. The \textit{enter} event
adds individuals to a node, for example, due to births. The
\textit{internal transfer} event moves individuals between
compartments within one node, for example, ageing of individuals in a
model with several age compartments or vaccination to move individuals
to a vaccinated compartment. The \textit{external transfer} event
moves individuals from compartments in one node to compartments in a
destination node. Finally, the \textit{exit} event removes individuals
from a node, for example, due to slaughter. The event types are
classified into those that operate on the compartments of a single
node $E_1 = \{\text{\textit{enter}, \textit{internal transfer},
  \textit{exit}}\}$ and those that operate on the compartments of two
nodes $E_2 = \{\text{\textit{external transfer}}\}$.  The parallel
algorithm processes these two classes of events differently, see
Appendix~\ref{sec:pseudo-code} for pseudo-code of the core simulation
solver.  The scheduled events are processed when simulation time
reaches the time for any of the events.  Events that are scheduled at
the same time are processed in the following order: \textit{exit},
\textit{enter}, \textit{internal transfer} and \textit{external
  transfer}.

The S4 class \code{SimInf\_events} contains slots with data structures
to process events (Table~\ref{table:scheduled:events}).  The slots
\code{event}, \code{time}, \code{node}, \code{dest}, \code{n},
\code{proportion}, \code{select} and \code{shift}, are vectors of
equal length.  These vectors hold data to process one event: \code{e},
where $1 <$ \code{e} $\leq$ \code{length(event)}.  The event type and
the time of the event are determined by \code{event[e]} and
\code{time[e]}, respectively.  The compartments that \code{event[e]}
operates on, are specified by \code{select[e]} together with the slot
\code{E}.  Each row $\{1, 2, ..., \Ncompartments\}$ in the sparse
matrix \code{E}, represents one compartment in the model.  Let \code{s
  <- select[e]}, then each non-zero entry in the column \code{E[, s]}
includes that compartment in the \code{event[e]} operation.  The
definitions of all of these operations are a bit involved and to
quickly get an overview, schematic pictures illustrating all of them
have been prepared, we refer to
Figures~\ref{fig:exit},\ref{fig:enter},\ref{fig:external},\ref{fig:internal},\ref{fig:external:shift}
in Appendix~\ref{sec:illustration-scheduled-events}.

\subsubsection{Processing of an enter event}

The \textit{enter} event adds \code{n[e]} individuals to one
compartment at \code{node[e]}, where the compartment is specified by a
non-zero entry in the row for the compartment in column \code{E[, s]}.
Please note that, if the column \code{E[, s]} contains several
non-zero entries, the individuals are added to the compartment
represented by the first non-zero row in column \code{E[, s]}.  The
values of \code{dest[e]}, \code{proportion[e]} and \code{shift[e]},
described below, are not used when processing an \textit{enter} event.
See Figure~\ref{fig:enter} in
Appendix~\ref{sec:illustration-scheduled-events} for an illustration
of a scheduled \textit{enter} event.

\subsubsection{Processing of an internal transfer event}

The \textit{internal transfer} event moves \code{n[e]} individuals
into new compartments within \code{node[e]}.  However, if \code{n[e]}
equals zero, the number of individuals to move is calculated by
multiplying the \code{proportion[e]} with the total number of
individuals in the compartments represented by the non-zero entries in
column \mbox{\code{E[, s]}}.  The individuals are then proportionally
sampled and removed from the compartments specified by \code{E[, s]}.
The next step is to move the sampled individuals to their new
compartment using the matrix \code{N} and \code{shift[e]}, where
\code{shift[e]} specifies which column in \code{N} to use.  Each row
$\{1, 2, ..., \Ncompartments\}$ in \code{N}, represents one
compartment in the model and the values determine how to move sampled
individuals before adding them to \code{node[e]} again.  Let \code{q
  <- shift[e]}, then each non-zero entry in \code{N[, q]} defines the
number of rows to move sampled individuals from that compartment i.e.,
sampled individuals from compartment \code{p} are moved to compartment
\code{N[p, q] + p}, where $1 \leq$ \code{N[p, q] + p} $\le
\Ncompartments$.  The value of \code{dest[e]}, described below, is not
used when processing an \textit{internal transfer} event.  See
Figure~\ref{fig:internal} in
Appendix~\ref{sec:illustration-scheduled-events} for an illustration
of a scheduled \textit{internal transfer} event.

\subsubsection{Processing of an external transfer event}

The \textit{external transfer} event moves individuals from
\code{node[e]} to \code{dest[e]}.  The sampling of individuals from
\code{node[e]} is performed in the same way as for an \textit{internal
  transfer} event.  The compartments at \code{node[e]} are updated by
subtracting the sampled individuals while adding them to the
compartments at \code{dest[e]}.  The sampled individuals are added to
the same compartments in \code{dest[e]} as in \code{node[e]}, unless
\code{shift[e]} $> 0$.  In that case, the sampled individuals change
compartments according to \code{N} as described in processing an
\textit{internal transfer} event before adding them to \code{dest[e]}.
See Figures \ref{fig:external} and \ref{fig:external:shift} in
Appendix~\ref{sec:illustration-scheduled-events} for illustrations of
scheduled \textit{external transfer} events.

\subsubsection{Processing of an exit event}

The \textit{exit} event removes individuals from \code{node[e]}.  The
sampling of individuals from \code{node[e]} is performed in the same
way as for an \textit{internal transfer} event.  The compartments at
\code{node[e]} are updated by subtracting the sampled individuals.
The values of \code{dest[e]} and \code{shift[e]} are not used when
processing an \textit{exit} event.  See Figure~\ref{fig:exit} in
Appendix~\ref{sec:illustration-scheduled-events} for an illustration
of a scheduled \textit{exit} event.

\subsection{Core simulation solver}

The \pkg{SimInf} package uses the ability to interface compiled code
from R \cite{Chambers2008}.  The solver is implemented in the compiled
language \proglang{C} \citep{Kernighan1988} and is called from
\proglang{R} using the \code{.Call()} interface \citep{Chambers2008}.
Using compiled rather than interpreted code ensures high performance
when running the model.  To improve performance further, the solver
uses \proglang{OpenMP} to divide work over multiple processors and
perform computations in parallel.  The solver uses GSL to generate
random numbers for the simulation.

\subsubsection{Function pointers}

The flexibility of the solver is partly achieved by using function
pointers \citep{Kernighan1988}.  A function pointer is a variable that
stores the address of a function that can be used to invoke the
function.  This provides a simple way to incorporate model specific
functionality into the solver.  A model must define one transition
rate function for each state transition in the model.  These functions
are called by the solver to calculate the transition rate for each
state transition in each node.  The output from the transition rate
function depends only on the state of the system at the current time.
However, the output is unique to a model and data are for that reason
passed on to the function for the calculation.  Furthermore, a model
must define the post time step function.  This function is called once
for each node each time the simulation of the continuous-time Markov
chain reaches the next day (or, more generally, the next unit of time)
and after the $E_1$ and $E_2$ events have been processed.  The main
purpose of the post time step function is to allow for a model to
update continuous state variables in each node.

The transition rate function is defined by the data type \code{TRFun}
and the post time step function by the data type \code{PTSFun}.  These
data types are defined in the header file \texttt{'src/SimInf.h'} and
shown below.  The arguments \code{v\_new}, \code{u}, \code{v},
\code{ldata}, \code{gdata}, \code{node}, and \code{t} of the functions
are described in Table~\ref{table:arguments}.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
  typedef double (*TRFun)(const int *u, const double *v, const double *ldata,
                          const double *gdata, double t);

  typedef int (*PTSFun)(double *v_new, const int *u, const double *v,
                        const double *ldata, const double *gdata,
                        int node, double t);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Overview of the solver}

Here follows an overview of the steps in the solver to run one
trajectory, see Appendix~\ref{sec:pseudo-code} for pseudo-code of the
core simulation solver and \texttt{'src/core/SimInf\_solver.c'} for
the source code.  The simulation starts with a call to the \code{run}
method with the model as the first argument and optionally the number
of threads to use and a seed for the random number generator.  This
method will first call the validity method on the model to perform
error-checking and then call a model specific \proglang{C} function to
initialize the function pointers to the transition rate functions and
the post time step function of the model.  Subsequently, the
simulation solver is called to run one trajectory using the model
specific data, the transition rate functions, and the post time step
function.  If the \code{C\_code} slot is non-empty, the \proglang{C}
code is written to a temporary file when the \code{run} method is
called.  The temporary file is compiled using \code{'R CMD SHLIB'} and
the resulting DLL is dynamically loaded.  The DLL is unloaded and the
temporary files are removed after running the model.  This is further
described in \S\ref{sec:extend}.

The solver simulates the trajectory in parallel if \proglang{OpenMP}
is available.  The default is to use all available threads.  However,
the user can specify the number of threads to use.  The solver divides
data for the $\Nnodes$ nodes and the $E_1$ events over the number
threads.  All $E_1$ events that affect node $i$ is processed in the
same thread as node $i$ is simulated in.  The $E_2$ events are
processed in the main thread.

The solver runs the continuous-time Markov chain for each node $i$.
For every time step $\tau_i$, the count in the compartments at node
$i$ is updated according to the state transition that occurred
(\S\ref{sec:model}).  The time to the next event is computed, after
recalculating affected transition rate functions (\S\ref{sec:model}).
When simulated time reaches the next day in node $i$ the $E_1$ events
are processed for that node (\S\ref{sec:events}).  The $E_2$ events
are processed when all nodes reaches the next day
(\S\ref{sec:events}).  Thereafter, the post time step function is
called to allow the model to incorporate model specific actions.  When
simulated time passes the next time in \code{tspan}, the count of the
compartments and the continuous state variables are written to
\code{U} and \code{V}.

  Specification of the \code{SIR} model without scheduled events}

This section illustrates the specification of the predefined
\code{SIR} model, which contains the three compartments susceptible
(\code{S}), infected (\code{I}) and recovered (\code{R}), where $\{S,
I, R\}$ represents the number of individuals in each of the three
compartments, respectively.  The transmission route of infection to
susceptible individuals is through direct contact between susceptible
and infected individuals.  The \code{SIR} model has two state
transitions in each node $i$,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SIR}
\begin{array}{rcl}
  S_i & \xrightarrow{\beta S_i I_i / (S_i+I_i+R_i)} & I_i, \\
  I_i &\xrightarrow{\gamma I_i} & R_i,
  \end{array}
\end{align}
where $\beta$ is the transmission rate and $\gamma$ is the recovery
rate.  The state change matrix \code{S} and the dependency graph
\code{G} for the \code{SIR} model are defined as follows

\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{img/SIR.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Schematic representation of the \code{SIR} compartment
    model in two nodes.  The \code{SIR} model is defined by the three
    disease states susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R).
    \textit{i)} State transitions between the $S$, $I$, and $R$
    compartments are modeled as a continuous-time discrete-state
    Markov process.  The other state transitions are due to scheduled
    events: \textit{ii)} \textit{enter} events, \textit{iii)}
    \textit{exit} events, and \textit{iv)} \textit{external transfer}
    events.  \label{fig:SIR-model}}
\end{figure}

\mathbf{S} =
\bordermatrix{
    & \enspace 1 & \enspace 2 \cr

                  & 1 & 2 \cr

\]
}

The first step in creating an \code{SIR} model object is to define
\code{u0}, a \code{data.frame} with the initial condition, i.e., the
number individuals in each compartment when the simulation starts.  We
will start in a node with 100 individuals of which 1 is infected.

<<SIR-u0>>=
u0 <- data.frame(S = 99, I = 1, R = 0)
@

Next, we define the time period over which we want to simulate the
disease spread.  This is a vector of integers in units of time or a
vector of dates.  You specify those time points in the vector that you
wish the model to return results for.  The model itself does not run
in discrete time steps, but continuous time, so this vector affects
only the start and end points of the simulation and the results that
you receive from the model, not the internal calculations of disease
transitions through time.  In this example we simulate for 6 months
returning results every $7^{th}$ day

<<SIR-tspan>>=
tspan <- seq(from = 1, to = 6 * 30, by = 7)
@

Before we can simulate from the model, we need to specify the
transmission rate, $\beta$, and the recovery rate, $\gamma$.

<<SIR-model>>=
model <- SIR(u0 = u0, tspan = tspan, beta = 0.16, gamma = 0.077)
@

We are now ready to run the model with these parameters and simulate
data.  We use the \code{threads} and \code{seed} arguments for
reproducibility.

<<SIR-run>>=
result <- run(model = model, threads = 1, seed = 22)
@

The \code{result} object contains the number of individuals in each
compartment at the time points specified in \code{tspan} and can be
extracted using the \code{trajectory} method as a \code{data.frame}.
Each line in the \code{data.frame} represents the information from one
node and time-point.  Below is an excerpt of the trajectory data

<<SIR-U>>=
head(trajectory(model = result))
@

The package \pkg{SimInf} has a \code{plot} method for objects of class
\code{SimInf_model}, such as the object \code{result}, which we can
use to display the outcome of the disease simulation in the single
node (Figure~\ref{fig:SIR-proportion}).

<<eval=FALSE>>=
plot(result)
@

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
<<SIR-plot-proportion, echo=FALSE,fig=TRUE>>=
plot(result)
@
  \end{center}
  \caption{Example of simulated data from one realization of the
    \code{SIR} model (Equation~\ref{eq:SIR}) in one node, starting
    with 99 susceptible, 1 infected, and 0 recovered
    individuals. \label{fig:SIR-proportion}}
\end{figure}

In order to run a simulation with multiple nodes we need to just add
those nodes to the initial \code{u0} \code{data.frame} that we
generate to start the model. If you were doing your own modeling of
many nodes, you would have a \code{data.frame} of your node population
that you read from, for example, a spreadsheet.  For now we will just
add another nodes to the \code{data.frame} here in \proglang{R}.

<<SIR-multiple-nodes>>=
u0 <- data.frame(S = c(99, 90), I = c( 1,  2), R = c( 0,  0))
model <- SIR(u0 = u0, tspan = tspan, beta = 0.16, gamma = 0.077)
result <- run(model = model, threads = 1, seed = 22)
@

If we inspect an excerpt of the trajectory, it now includes results
from two nodes above one another for each time point in the
\code{tspan} vector.

<<SIR-U-multiple-nodes>>=
head(trajectory(model = result))
@

\subsubsection[Specification of scheduled events in the SIR model]{%
  Specification of scheduled events in the \code{SIR} model}

In this example, we will continue to work with the predefined
\code{SIR} model to explore a within node disease spread similar to
the first SIR example but with the additional feature that individuals
enter and exit the simulation and that the disease can spread between
nodes via movements of infected individuals between nodes.

We will start with the inclusion of a set of individuals that are
moved between nodes in the network (\textit{external transfer}
events). These events are predefined prior to the simulation and are
applied during the simulation process. For example, if your simulation
time is in days, then after each day, \pkg{SimInf} will apply the
events in the data and move individuals between nodes.  In the
following example we have five nodes with movements between nodes. To
illustrate the movements themselves, we have only started with 30
individuals in the first node and the other four are empty, and we
will run the simulation for five time steps:

<<SIR-u0-multiple-nodes>>=
u0 <- data.frame(S = c(10, 0, 0, 0, 0), I = c(10, 0, 0, 0, 0),
R = c(10, 0, 0, 0, 0))
@

Now we will define 6 scheduled events to include in the simulation.
Below is a \code{data.frame}, that contains the events.  Interpret it
as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em
\item In time step 2 we add 2 susceptible individuals to node 2
\item In time step 3 we move 2 individuals from node 1 to node 3
\item In time step 4 we remove 1 individual from node 2
\item In time step 4 we move 1 individual from node 1 to node 3
\item In time step 4 we move 1 individual from node 1 to node 4
\item In time step 5 we move 2 individuals from node 1 to node 5
\end{enumerate}

<<SIR-events, echo=FALSE>>=
events <- data.frame(
event = c("enter", "extTrans", "exit", "extTrans", "extTrans", "extTrans"),
time = c(2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5), node = c(2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1),
dest = c(0, 3, 0, 3, 4, 5), n = c(2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2),
proportion = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), select = c(1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
shift = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))
@

<<SIR-events-show>>=
events
@

Now we are ready to run the simulation using the events and the
disease spread model as we did in earlier examples:

<<U-model-events>>=
model <- SIR(u0 = u0, tspan = 1:5, events = events, beta = 0.16,
gamma = 0.077)
result <- run(model = model, threads = 1, seed = 22)
trajectory(model = result)
@

If you inspect the result of this very simple simulation, you will see
that 2 individuals were added to node 2, of which one individual was
later removed, and that some individuals were removed from node 1 and
placed in nodes 3, 4, and 5.  So far this is not really
earth-shattering, but if we do this again with a few more individuals
then we can see how disease can spread from an infected node to a
non-infected one. We will start with 5 nodes again, but node 1 is
infected and nodes 2--5 now each have 100 susceptible and the
simulation will run for 75 days:

<<SIR-u0-multiple-nodes-II>>=
u0 <- data.frame(S = c(90, 100, 100, 100, 100), I = c(10, 0, 0, 0, 0),
R = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0))
@

And then we have a few movements of individuals from node 1 to the others:

<<SIR-events-II, echo=FALSE>>=
events <- data.frame(event = c("extTrans", "extTrans", "extTrans", "extTrans"),
time = c(3, 25, 5, 10), node = c(1, 1, 1, 1), dest = c(3, 2, 3, 3),
n = c(1, 9, 1, 5), proportion = c(0, 0, 0, 0), select = c(2, 2, 2, 2),
shift = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
@

<<SIR-events-II-show>>=
events
@

Initialize and run the model

<<SIR-events-II-run>>=
model <- SIR(u0 = u0, tspan = 1:75, events = events, beta = 0.16,
gamma = 0.077)
result <- run(model = model, threads = 1, seed = 5)
@

Figure~\ref{fig:SIR-spaghetti} shows the result from running the
model.  Note the time that it takes for node 2 to become positive
relative to the movements.  On day 25, 10 individuals are moved to the
node causing the outbreak.  Also despite the fact that we moved
individuals from node 1 to node 3, there was no outbreak in node 3.
This is because of the random selection process that select
susceptible, infected or recovered individuals to move between the
nodes.

plot(result, N = TRUE, spaghetti = TRUE, compartments = "I")

\subsubsection[C code for the SIR model]{%
  \proglang{C} code for the \code{SIR} model}

The \proglang{C} code for the \code{SIR} model is defined in the
source file \texttt{'src/models/SIR.c'}.  This file contains the
\code{SIR_run} function to initialize the core solver
(Listing~\ref{lst:SIRrun} in Appendix~\ref{sec:C-code-SIR}), the
transition rate functions (Listing~\ref{lst:trSIR} in
Appendix~\ref{sec:C-code-SIR}) and the post time step function
(Listing~\ref{lst:ptsSIR} in Appendix~\ref{sec:C-code-SIR}).

\subsection[A second example: The SISe3_sp model]{%
  A second example: The \code{SISe3\_sp} model}
\label{sec:example-SISe3_sp}

This section illustrates the specification of the \code{SISe3\_sp}
model, which is also predefined in the \pkg{SimInf} package.  Two
additional features, compared to the \code{SIR} model, are used by the
\code{SISe3\_sp} model: ageing of individuals by \textit{internal
  transfer} events, and usage of the real valued continuous state $V$.
The \code{SISe3\_sp} model contains the two compartments susceptible
(\code{S}) and infected (\code{I}) divided into the three age
categories $j = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and the local environmental compartment
(\code{e}) contaminated with free living pathogens
(Figure~\ref{fig:SISe3_sp}).  Moreover, nodes are connected spatially
with local spread of the contaminated environmental compartment among
proximal nodes.  The transmission route of infection to susceptible
individuals is indirect via the local environment, contaminated by
infected individuals.  The number of individuals in each of the six
compartments $\{S_1, I_1, S_2, I_2, S_3, I_3\}$ in node $i$ at time
$t$ is \mbox{\code{u[, i]}}.  The \code{SISe3\_sp} model has two state
transitions within each of the three age categories,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:vtectrans}
\begin{array}{rcl}
  S_{ij} & \xrightarrow{\upsilon_j \varphi_i} & I_{ij}, \\
  I_{ij} & \xrightarrow{\gamma_j} & S_{ij},
  \end{array}
\end{align}

where the state transition from susceptible to infected depends on the
concentration of the environmental contamination $\varphi_i(t)$ of the
pathogen in node $i$ and the indirect transmission rate $\upsilon_j$.
The state transition from infected to susceptible depends on the
recovery rate $\gamma_j$.  Finally, the environmental infectious
pressure is evolved by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:envInfPressure-local-spread}
  \frac{d \varphi_i(t)}{dt}= \frac{\alpha I_i(t)}{N_i(t)} +
  \sum_k{\frac{\varphi_k(t) N_k(t) - \varphi_i(t) N_i(t)}{N_i(t)}
    \cdot \frac{D}{d_{ik}}} - \beta(t) \varphi_i(t),
\end{equation}

where the constant $\alpha$ is the average shedding rate of the
pathogen to the environment per infected individual, and $N_i = S_i +
I_i$ the size of node $i$.  The decay and removal of the pathogen is
captured by $\beta$, which is allowed to vary with time.  A spatial
component with local spread among proximal nodes is also included in
the model, where $D$ is the rate of the local spread and $d_{ik}$ the
distance between the two holdings $i$ and $k$.  When running a
trajectory of the \code{SISe3\_sp} model, the environmental infectious
pressure $\varphi_i(t)$ in each node is evolved in the post-time-step
function by the Euler forward method. The value of $\varphi_i(t)$ is
saved to the \code{V} matrix at the time-points specified by
\code{tspan}.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.70\linewidth]{img/SISe3_sp.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Schematic representation of the \code{SISe3\_sp}
    compartment model in two nodes.  The \code{SISe3\_sp} model is
    defined by the two disease states susceptible (S) and infected (I)
    in three age categories and indirect transmission via an
    environmental infectious pressure $\varphi_i$.  \textit{i)} State
    transitions between the $S$ and $I$ compartments are modeled as a
    continuous-time discrete-state Markov process.  The other state
    transitions are due to scheduled events: \textit{ii)}
    \textit{enter} events, \textit{iii)} \textit{internal transfer}
    events, \textit{iv)} \textit{external transfer} events, and
    \textit{v)} \textit{exit} events.  The environmental infectious
    pressure $\varphi_i$ is modeled with an ordinary differential
    equation and by default evolved by the Euler forward
    method.  \label{fig:SISe3_sp}}

\subsubsection[Illustration of the stochastic step in the SISe3_sp model]{%
  Illustration of the stochastic step in the \code{SISe3\_sp} model}

To illustrate the stochastic step in Equation~\ref{eq:numstep3},
consider that the number of individuals in each compartment in node
$i$ \code{u[, i]} at time $t$ is $\{12, 3, 63, 14, 92, 2\}$ and that
the time to the next state transition is $\tau_i$.  Furthermore,
assume that the next state transition is infected to susceptible in
the first age category which corresponds to the second column in the
state change matrix \code{S}.  Thus, updating the compartments
corresponds to adding \code{S[, 2]} to \code{u[, i]}, which gives
$\{13, 2, 63, 14, 92, 2\}$.  This also implies that the transition
rates for the two transitions $S_{i,1} \rightarrow I_{i,1}$ and
$I_{i,1} \rightarrow S_{i,1}$ must be recalculated according to
\code{G[, 2]}.

\subsubsection[Specification of scheduled events in the SISe3_sp model]{%
  Specification of scheduled events in the \code{SISe3\_sp} model}

The \code{SISe3\_sp} model have been specified to handle births,
imports, ageing, moving and exits of individuals
(Table~\ref{table:SISe3_sp:events} in
Appendix~\ref{sec:illustration-scheduled-events}).  When individuals
enter the model (births, imports), they are added to the susceptible
state in the age category specified by column 1, 2 or 3 in \code{E}.
The columns 4, 5 and 6 in \code{E} are used for the other events
(ageing, moving, exit) to sample individuals from the susceptible and
infected states from each of the three ages categories.  To move the
sampled individuals in a \textit{internal transfer} event (ageing)
from age category 1 to age category 2, the susceptible and infected
states should shift two steps to the corresponding state in age
category 2, as specified in \code{N[, 1]}.  Similarly, \code{N[, 2]}
move susceptible and infected individuals from age category 2 to age
category 3.

\subsubsection[Case study using the SISe3_sp model]{%
  Case study using the \code{SISe3\_sp} model}

In this section we will demonstrate how to construct and use the
\code{SISe3\_sp} model together with synthetic cattle events and
population data included with the package \pkg{SimInf}.  The data
defines the initial population divided into three age categories (0
days $\le$ \textit{age 1} $<$ 120 days, 120 days $\le$ \textit{age 2}
$<$ 365 days and \textit{age 3} $\ge$ 365 days) in 1600 nodes and
scheduled events over $4 \times 365$ days.  The two data sets for the
model are loaded with

<<load-SISe3sp-events>>=
data("u0_SISe3", package = "SimInf")
data("events_SISe3", package = "SimInf")
@

To model local spread of the environmental infectious pressure among
proximal nodes, we have to generate a distance matrix.  Let us use the
synthetic data set \code{nodes} included in the \pkg{SimInf} package,
which defines a cattle population consisting of 1600 herds located in
a 50 square kilometer region, and let proximal neighbors be defined as
neighbors within 2500m.

<<load-nodes>>=
data("nodes", package = "SimInf")
d <- distance_matrix(x = nodes$x, y = nodes$y, cutoff = 2500)
@

Next we define \code{tspan} to simulate for 4 consecutive years
returning the results every $7^{th}$ day

<<create-SISe3sp-tspan>>=
tspan <- seq(from = 1, to = 4 * 365, by = 7)
@

We are now ready to create an \code{SISe3_sp} object using the
\code{SISe3_sp} generating method.  The parameters in the example were
chosen such that the proportion of infected nodes in a trajectory is
about 10\% and have a seasonal pattern.  We assume that the average
duration of infection is 10 days in all age categories, such that the
recovery rate $\gamma_{1,2,3} = 0.1$ per animal per day, and assume
that the indirect transmission rate of the environmental infectious
pressure $\gamma$ is equal in all age categories.  Moreover, we fix
the average shedding rate $\alpha = 1$ and allow the decay of the
bacteria to vary in four seasonal intervals, $\beta_1, ..., \beta_4$
over the year. The end point (day of the year) for each season
\code{beta\_t1}, ..., \code{beta\_t4} is determined by \code{end\_t1},
..., \code{end\_t4}, respectively. We let the local environmental
infectious pressure $\varphi_i = 0$ at the beginning of the simulation
and let 10\% of the herds start with 5\% infected individuals.

<<create-SISe3sp-u0>>=
set.seed(123)
i <- sample(x = 1:1600, size = 160)
u0_SISe3$I_1[i] <- as.integer(u0_SISe3$S_1[i] * 0.05)
u0_SISe3$I_2[i] <- as.integer(u0_SISe3$S_2[i] * 0.05)
u0_SISe3$I_3[i] <- as.integer(u0_SISe3$S_3[i] * 0.05)
u0_SISe3$S_1[i] <- u0_SISe3$S_1[i] - u0_SISe3$I_1[i]
u0_SISe3$S_2[i] <- u0_SISe3$S_2[i] - u0_SISe3$I_2[i]
u0_SISe3$S_3[i] <- u0_SISe3$S_3[i] - u0_SISe3$I_3[i]
@

Let us now construct an \code{SISe3\_sp} model object

<<create-SISe3sp>>=
model <- SISe3_sp(u0 = u0_SISe3, tspan = tspan, phi = rep(0, 1600),
events = events_SISe3, upsilon_1 = 0.013, upsilon_2 = 0.013, upsilon_3
= 0.013, gamma_1 = 0.1, gamma_2 = 0.1, gamma_3 = 0.1, alpha = 1,
beta_t1 = 0.095, beta_t2 = 0.12, beta_t3 = 0.10, beta_t4 = 0.15,
end_t1 = 91, end_t2 = 182, end_t3 = 273, end_t4 = 365, distance = d,
coupling = 0.1)
@

where \code{phi}, \code{beta\_t1}, ..., \code{beta\_t4},
\code{end\_t1}, ..., \code{end\_t4}, and \code{distance} is local data
to each node, and passed to the transition rate functions and the
post-time step function in the \code{ldata} parameter.

The package \pkg{SimInf} has a \code{summary} method for objects of
class \code{SimInf_model}, such as the object \code{model}, which
generates a detailed summary of various data in the model and the
simulated trajectory.  Let us run a trajectory to illustrate this.

<<SISe3sp-model-summary>>=
result <- run(model = model, threads = 1, seed = 1)
summary(result)
@

Furthermore, we can display the distribution of the scheduled events
over time.  Note that the synthetic events have been generated to
illustrate features of the \pkg{SimInf} package and not to incorporate
the full complexity of population demographics and a temporal network.
The synthetic data mimics seasonality in real livestock data
\cite{Bajardi2011, Dutta2014, Widgren2016}, such that the number of
scheduled events varies over time, see
Figure~\ref{fig:scheduled-events-SISe3}.  However, the between-node
movements (\textit{external transfer}) have been generated from random
connections, which is probably not realistic for real livestock data.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
<<display-SISe3sp-model, fig=TRUE>>=
plot(events(model))
@
  \end{center}
  \caption{The distribution of the synthetic scheduled events data set
    \code{events\_SISe3}, that is distributed with the \pkg{SimInf}
    package.  The \textit{enter} event adds individuals to a node.
    The \textit{internal transfer} event changes the number of
    individuals in the compartments within one node.  The
    \textit{external transfer} event moves individuals from
    compartments in one node to compartments in a destination node.
    Finally, the \textit{exit} event removes individuals from a node.}
  \label{fig:scheduled-events-SISe3}
\end{figure}

The scheduled events give rise to a seasonal variation of the
population size in each age category that can be explored using data
in the \code{U} matrix.  The \code{U} method take a
\code{compartments} argument that can be used to determine the
population size by age category.  Let us first run a trajectory to
generate data, and then plot the number of individuals in each age
category (Figure~\ref{fig:population}).

We might now be interested in exploring how various changes to the
model could influence the spread of infection in the population of
interconnected nodes.  Let us compare the spatio-temporal distribution
of disease spread when removing the effect of animal movements and
local spread.  First, we need to create a utility function to visualize
the spatio-temporal spread at evenly spaced time-points.

<<echo=false, results=hide>>=
options(continue = "+  ")
@

<<plot-infected-nodes>>=
plot_nodes <- function(x) {
  wnp <- prevalence(x, I_1+I_2+I_3~., type = "wnp", as.is = TRUE) > 0
  opar <- par(mfrow = c(3, 6), mar = c(2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3))
  on.exit(par(opar))
  for(i in seq(1, dim(wnp)[2], length.out = 18)) {
    Si <- which(!wnp[, i])
    Ii <- which(wnp[, i])
    plot(nodes$x[Si], nodes$y[Si], col = "yellow", pch = 20, xlab = "",
      ylab = "", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", ann = FALSE)
    day <- 7 * as.integer(i - 1) + 1
    mtext(sprintf("Day: %i", day), side = 1, line = 0.5)
    points(nodes$x[Ii], nodes$y[Ii], col = "blue", pch = 20)
  }
}
@

<<echo=false, results=hide>>=
options(continue = "+    ")
@

To remove local spread, we have only to set the \code{coupling}
parameter to zero and run the model
(Figure~\ref{fig:SISe3sp-movements}).

We would also like to explore the effect on the disease-spread when
considering local spread only.  However, removing all the
\textit{external transfer} events could potentially set a node in a
state where the other event types cannot be handled due to too few
animals in the node.  Another approach to solve this is to shift all
infected animals to the susceptible state during an \textit{external
  transfer} event so that infection is not transferred, even though an
animal is moved.  This can be achieved in \pkg{SimInf} by adding one
column to the shift matrix \code{N} and use that column for the
\textit{external transfer} events.
Figure~\ref{fig:SISe3sp-local-spread} shows the result from running
one trajectory with the modified model.

<<eval=FALSE>>=
model@gdata["coupling"] <- 0.1
model@events@N <- cbind(model@events@N,

i <- which(model@events@event == 3)
model@events@shift[i] <- 3L
plot_nodes(run(model = model, threads = 1, seed = 1))
@

In this example, removing either local spread or animal movements was
not sufficient to eradicate the disease
(Figure~\ref{fig:SISe3sp-spread-in-population}).

\section[Extending SimInf: New models]{Extending \pkg{SimInf}: New models}
\label{sec:extend}

One of the design goals of \pkg{SimInf} was to make it extendable.
The current design supports two ways to extend \pkg{SimInf} with new
models, and this section describes the relevant steps to implement a
new model.  Since extending \pkg{SimInf} requires that \proglang{C}
code can be compiled, you will first need to install a compiler.  To
read more about interfacing compiled code from \proglang{R} and
creating \proglang{R} add-on packages, the \texttt{'Writing R
  extensions'}
(\url{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html})
manual is the official guide and describes the process in detail.
Another useful resource is the \texttt{'R packages'} book by
\cite{Hadley2015} (\url{http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/}).

\subsection{Using the model parser to define a new model}
\label{sec:mparse}

The simplest way to define a new model for \pkg{SimInf} is to use the
model parser method \code{mparse}.  It takes a character vector of
transitions in the form of \code{"X -> propensity -> Y"} and
generates: the \proglang{C} code for the model, the state-change
matrix \code{S}, and the dependency graph \code{G}.  The left hand
side of the first '\code{->}'-sign is the initial state, the right
hand side of the last '\code{->}'-sign is the final state, and the
propensity is written between the '\code{->}'-signs.  The special
symbol '\code{@}' is reserved for the empty set $\emptyset$.  We
suggest to first draw a schematic representation of the model that
includes all compartments and arrows for all state transitions.  Then
list the compartments in the order they should appear in the \code{S}
matrix.

\subsubsection[Introductory examples of using mparse]{%
  Introductory examples of using \code{mparse}}
\label{sec:mparse-introductory-examples}

In a first example we will consider the SIR model in a closed
population i.e., no births or deaths.  If we let \code{b} denote the
transmission rate and \code{g} the recovery rate, the model can be
described as,

<<SIR-mparse-I>>=
transitions <- c("S -> b*S*I/(S+I+R) -> I", "I -> g*I -> R")
compartments <- c("S", "I", "R")
@

We can now use the \code{transitions} and \code{compartments}
variables, together with the constants \code{b} and \code{g} to build
an object of class \code{'SimInf\_mparse'} via a call to
\code{mparse}.  Before we can simulate from the model, it needs to be
initialized with the initial condition \code{u0} and \code{tspan}.

<<SIR-mparse-II>>=
m <- mparse(transitions, compartments, b = 0.16, g = 0.077)
model <- init(m, u0 = cbind(S = 99, I = 1, R = 0), tspan = 1:180)
@

As in earlier examples, the \code{model} object can now be used to
simulate data and plot the results.  Internally, the \proglang{C} code
that was generated by \code{mparse} is written to a temporary file
when the \code{run} method is called.  If the temporary file is
compiled successfully, the resulting DLL is dynamically loaded and
used to run one trajectory of the model.  Once the simulator
completes, the DLL is unloaded and the temporary files are removed.

<<SIR-mparse-III, eval=FALSE>>=
result <- run(model = model, threads = 1, seed = 22)
plot(result)
@

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
<<SIR-mparse-IV, echo=FALSE, fig=TRUE>>=
result <- run(model = model, threads = 1, seed = 22)
plot(result)
@
  \caption{Example of simulated data from one realization of the
    \code{mparse} \code{SIR} model (Equation~\ref{eq:SIR}) in one
    node, starting with 99 susceptible, 1 infected, and 0 recovered
    individuals. \label{fig:SIR-mparse-proportion}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The flexibility of the \code{mparse} approach allows for quick
prototyping of new models or features.  Let us elaborate on the
previous example and explore the incidence cases per day.  This can
easily be done by adding one compartment \code{'Icum'} whose sole
purpose is to keep track of how many individuals who become infected
over time.  The right hand side \code{'I + Icum'} of the transition
\code{'S -> b*S*I/(S+I+R) -> I + Icum'}, means that both \code{'I'}
and \code{'Icum'} are incremented by one each time the transition
happens.  We then calculate successive differences at each time-point
in \code{'Icum'} and plot the result as an epidemic curve
(Figure~\ref{fig:SIR-mparse-incidence}).

<<SIR-mparse-incidence, eval=FALSE>>=
m <- mparse(c("S -> b*S*I/(S+I+R) -> I + Icum", "I -> g*I -> R"),
c("S", "I", "Icum", "R"), b = 0.16, g = 0.077)
model <- init(m, cbind(S = 99, I = 1, Icum = 0, R = 0), 1:180)
result <- run(model, threads = 1, seed = 22)
Icum <- trajectory(result)$Icum

\subsubsection[Incorporate scheduled events in an mparse model]{%
  Incorporate scheduled events in an \code{mparse} model}
\label{sec:mparse-scheduled-events}

Let us expand on the previous example to illustrate how models
generated using \code{mparse} can incorporate scheduled events.
Consider an epidemic in a population consisting of 1600 nodes, for
example, cattle herds, that are connected to each other by livestock
movements.  Assume the outbreak is detected on day twenty-one after
introduction and that we wish to explore how vaccination could limit
the outbreak, if resources for vaccination can handle 50 herds per day
and 80\% of the animals in each herd.  Let us add one compartment $V$
to the model, to represent vaccinated individuals, so that the model
now contains the $\{S, I, I_{cum}, R, V \}$ compartments.  As before,
let \code{b} denote the transmission rate and \code{g} the recovery
rate.

<<mparse-scheduled-events>>=
transitions <- c("S -> b*S*I/(S+I+R+V) -> I + Icum", "I -> g*I -> R")
compartments <- c("S", "I", "Icum", "R", "V")
m <- mparse(transitions, compartments, b = 0.16, g = 0.077)
@

Load the example data for an \code{SIR} model in a population of 1600
nodes (cattle herds) with its associated scheduled events: births,
deaths, and livestock movements.  Let $I_{cum} = 0$ and $R = 0$.

<<mparse-scheduled-events-data>>=
u0 <- u0_SIR()
u0$Icum <- 0
u0$V <- 0
events <- events_SIR()
@

Now generate vaccination events i.e., \textit{internal transfer}
events (\code{event = 2}).  Use \code{select = 3} and \code{shift = 1}
to move animals from the susceptible, infectious and recovered
compartments to the vaccinated compartment, see the definitions of $E$
and $N$ below.  Let us start the vaccinations in nodes 1--50 on day
twenty-one, and continue until all herds are vaccinated on day
fifty-two, and use \code{proportion = 0.8} to vaccinate 80\% of the
animals in each herd.  We assume, for the sake of simplicity, that
vaccinated individuals become immune and non-infectious immediately.

<<mparse-scheduled-events-vaccination>>=
vaccination <- data.frame(event = 2, time = rep(21:52, each = 50),
node = 1:1600, dest = 0, n = 0, proportion = 0.8, select = 3,
shift = 1)
@

To simulate from this model, we have to define the event matrix $E$
and the shift matrix $N$, to handle which compartments to sample from
when processing scheduled events.  Let us first define $E$, where the
first column is for \textit{enter} events (births); add newborn
animals to the susceptible compartment $S$.  The second column is for
\textit{exit} events (deaths) and \textit{external transfer} events
(livestock movements); sample animals from the $S$, $I$, $R$ or $V$
compartments.  Finally, the third column is for \textit{internal
  transfer} events (vaccination); sample individuals from the $S$, $I$
or $R$ compartments.  Then define the shift matrix $N$ to process
\textit{internal transfer} events (vaccination); move sampled animals
from the $S$ compartment four steps forward to the $V$ compartment.
Similarly, move sampled animals from the $I$ compartment three steps
forward to the $V$ compartment, and finally, move sampled individuals
from the $R$ compartment one step forward.

{\small
\[
\mathbf{E} =
\bordermatrix{
         & 1 & 2 & 3 \cr
  S      & 1 & 1 & 1 \cr
  I      & 0 & 1 & 1 \cr
  I_{cum} & 0 & 0 & 0 \cr
  R      & 0 & 1 & 1 \cr
  V      & 0 & 1 & 0} \qquad
\mathbf{N} =
\bordermatrix{
         & 1 \cr
  S      & 4 \cr
  I      & 3 \cr
  I_{cum} & 0 \cr
  R      & 1 \cr
  V      & 0}
\]
}

<<mparse-scheduled-events-E-N>>=
E <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0), nrow = 5,
ncol = 3, dimnames = list(c("S", "I", "Icum", "R", "V"),
c("1", "2", "3")))
N <- matrix(c(4, 3, 0, 1, 0), nrow = 5, ncol = 1,
dimnames = list(c("S", "I", "Icum", "R", "V"), "1"))
@

Now let us create an \code{epicurve} function to estimate the average
number of new cases per day from \code{n = 1000} realizations of a
\code{model} object in a \code{for} loop.  To clear infection that was
introduced in the previous trajectory, animals are first moved to the
susceptible compartment.  Then, one infected individual is introduced
into a randomly sampled node from the population.  Note that we use
the 'L' suffix to create an integer value rather than a numeric value.
Run the model and accumulate \code{Icum}, for efficiency, use
\code{as.is = TRUE}, the internal matrix format, to extract
\code{Icum} in every node at each time-point in \code{tspan}.

<<echo=false, results=hide>>=
options(continue = "+  ")
@

<<mparse-scheduled-events-epicurve>>=
epicurve <- function(model, n = 1000) {
  Icum <- numeric(length(model@tspan))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    model@u0["S", ] <- model@u0["S", ] + model@u0["I", ]
    model@u0["I", ] <- 0L
    j <- sample(seq_len(Nn(model)), 1)
    model@u0["I", j] <- 1L
    model@u0["S", j] <- model@u0["S", j] - 1L
    result <- run(model)
    Icum <- Icum + colSums(trajectory(result, "Icum", as.is = TRUE))
  }
  stepfun(model@tspan[-1], diff(c(0, Icum / n)))
}
@

<<echo=false, results=hide>>=
options(continue = "+    ")
@

Generate an epicurve with the average number of cases per day for the
first three hundred days of the epidemic without vaccination.

<<mparse-scheduled-events-model-no-vac, eval=FALSE>>=
model_no_vac <- init(m, u0 = u0, tspan = 1:300, events = events,
E = E, N = N)
cases_no_vac <- epicurve(model_no_vac)
@

Similarly, generate an epicurve after incorporating the
\code{vaccination} events.

<<mparse-scheduled-events-model-vac, eval=FALSE>>=
model_vac <- init(m, u0 = u0, tspan = 1:300, events =
rbind(events, vaccination), E = E, N = N)
cases_vac <- epicurve(model_vac)
@

As expected, the number of cases decrease rapidly after vaccination,
while the outbreak is ongoing for a longer time in the unvaccinated
population (Figure~\ref{fig:mparse-epicurve}).

<<mparse-scheduled-events-plot, eval=FALSE>>=
plot(cases_no_vac, main = "", xlim = c(0, 300), xlab = "Time",
ylab = "Number of cases", do.points = FALSE)
lines(cases_vac, col = "blue", do.points = FALSE, lty = 2)
abline(v = 21, col = "red", lty = 3)
legend("topright", c("No vaccination", "Vaccination"),
col = c("black", "blue"), lty = 1:2)
@

    initiated.  \label{fig:mparse-epicurve}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Predator-prey model}
\label{sec:mparse-predator-prey}

Although \pkg{SimInf} was designed to study disease spread over
temporal networks, it is not limited to that use case but can also be
used to study the dynamics of other systems.  In a final \code{mparse}
example we will illustrate the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey
model demonstrated in the \pkg{GillespieSSA} package
\citep{Rosenzweig1963, Pineda-Krch2008}.  The model has a
density-dependent growth in the prey and and a nonlinear Type-2
functional response in the predator \citep{Rosenzweig1963}.  Let $R$
and $F$ denote the number of prey and predators, respectively.  The
model consists of five transitions (Equation~\ref{eq:predator-prey}):
\textit{i)} prey birth, \textit{ii)} prey death due to non-predatory
events, \textit{iii)} prey death due to predation, \textit{iv)}
predator birth, and \textit{v)} predator death

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:predator-prey}
  \left.
     \begin{array}{rcl}
      \emptyset & \xrightarrow{b_R \cdot R} & R \\
      R & \xrightarrow{(d_R+(b_R-d_R) \cdot R/K) \cdot R} & \emptyset \\
      R & \xrightarrow{\alpha/(1+w \cdot R) \cdot R \cdot F} & \emptyset \\
      \emptyset & \xrightarrow{b_F \cdot \alpha/(1+w \cdot R) \cdot R \cdot F} & F \\
      F & \xrightarrow{d_F \cdot F} & \emptyset \\
    \end{array}
  \right\},
\end{align}

where $b_R$, $d_R$, $b_F$, and $d_F$ are the per capita birth and
death rate of the prey and predator, respectively.  Furthermore, $K$
is the carrying capacity of the prey, $\alpha$ is the predation
efficiency, and $w$ is the degree of predator saturation
\citep{Pineda-Krch2008}.  Using parameter values from
\cite{Pineda-Krch2008}, we define the model as

<<mparse-predator-prey, eval=FALSE>>=
m <- mparse(transitions = c("@ -> bR*R -> R",
"R -> (dR+(bR-dR)*R/K)*R -> @", "R -> alpha/(1+w*R)*R*F -> @",
"@ -> bF*alpha/(1+w*R)*R*F -> F", "F -> dF*F -> @"),
compartments = c("R", "F"), bR = 2, bF = 2, dR = 1, K = 1000,
alpha = 0.007, w = 0.0035, dF = 2)
model <- init(m, cbind(R = 1000, F = 100), 1:100)
result <- run(model, threads = 1, seed = 1)
plot(result, N = TRUE)

"@ -> bF*alpha/(1+w*R)*R*F -> F", "F -> dF*F -> @"),
compartments = c("R", "F"), bR = 2, bF = 2, dR = 1, K = 1000,
alpha = 0.007, w = 0.0035, dF = 2)
model <- init(m, cbind(R = 1000, F = 100), 1:100)

\subsection[Use the SimInf framework from another package]{%
  Use the \pkg{SimInf} framework from another package}
\label{sec:linking-to}

Another possibility is to extend \pkg{SimInf} by creating an
\proglang{R} add-on package that uses \pkg{SimInf} by linking to its
core solver native routine, and this section describes the relevant
steps to achieve this.  Consider we wish to create a new add-on
package \pkg{PredatorPrey} based on the Rosenzweig-MacArthur
predator-prey model from the previous section.  To facilitate this,
the \pkg{SimInf} package includes a method (\code{package_skeleton})
that automates some of the setup for a new source package.  It creates
directories, saves \proglang{R} and \proglang{C} code files to
appropriate places, and creates skeleton help files.

<<create-package-skeleton, eval=FALSE>>=
path <- tempdir()
package_skeleton(m, "PredatorPrey", path = path)
@

where the first argument is the result (\code{SimInf_mparse} object)
from the \code{mparse} method, and the second argument is the name of
the package to create a skeleton for.  The created \proglang{R} file
(\texttt{'R/models.R'}) defines the \code{S4} class
\code{PredatorPrey} that contains the \code{SimInf\_model} and a
generating function to create a new object of the \code{PredatorPrey}
model.  The generating function is a template that might need to be
updated to meet the specific requirements of the model, for example,
if the model should handle scheduled events, then \code{E} must be
specified to select the subset of compartments involved in each
specific event.  Furthermore, if one of the events is an
\textit{internal transfer} event, \code{N} must be specified to shift
individuals between compartments within one holding.  It is also
possible to define parameters that are either local (\code{ldata}) to
each node or shared (\code{gdata}) between all nodes.

The \proglang{C} file (\texttt{'src/models.c'}) defines one function
for each state transition, the post time step function and the model
specific run function, and is automatically compiled when installing
the package.  The header file \code{"SimInf.h"} contains the
declarations for these functions and should be included.  The
\code{SimInf_model_run} function is the interface from \proglang{R} to
the core solver in \proglang{C} and list all function pointers to the
transition rate functions in a vector in the order the state
transitions appear in the dependency graph \code{G}, see
Listing~\ref{lst:SIRrun} in Appendix~\ref{sec:C-code-SIR} for an
example from the \code{SIR} model and the use of the address of
operator \code{'\&'} to obtain the address of a function.  The
\code{SimInf_model_run} function must return the result from the call
to the core solver with \code{SimInf_run}.  The arguments to
\code{SimInf_run} are the arguments passed to the
\code{SimInd_model_run} function plus the vector of function pointers
to the transition rate functions and the function pointer to the post
time step function.  To facilitate extraction of specific values from
the data structures passed as arguments to the transition rate
functions and the post time step function, we recommend using
enumeration declarations to name the values, see
Listing~\ref{lst:trSIR} in Appendix~\ref{sec:C-code-SIR} for an
example.

The add-on \pkg{PredatorPrey} source package can now be built and
installed with

<<install-package-skeleton, eval=FALSE>>=
pkg <- file.path(path, "PredatorPrey")
install.packages(pkg, repos = NULL, type = "source")
@

If the installation was successful, the newly installed package
\pkg{PredatorPrey} can be loaded in \proglang{R} with the following
command.

<<load-package-skeleton, eval=FALSE>>=
library("PredatorPrey")
@

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have introduced the \proglang{R} package \pkg{SimInf}
which supports data-driven simulations of disease transmission over
spatio-temporal networks. The package offers a very efficient and
highly flexible tool to incorporate real data in simulations at
realistic scales.

We hope that our package will facilitate incorporating large volumes
of available data, for example, livestock data, in network epidemic
models to better understand disease transmission in a temporal network
and improve design of intervention strategies for endemic and emerging
threats.  Future efforts will be concentrated on a software
development driven predominantly by actual use cases.
