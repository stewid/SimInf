# SimInf

The package provides an efficient and very flexible framework to
conduct data-driven epidemiological modeling in realistic large scale
disease spread simulations. The framework integrates infection
dynamics in subpopulations as continuous-time Markov chains using the
Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm and incorporates available
data such as births, deaths and movements as scheduled events at
predefined time-points. Using C code for the numerical solvers and
'OpenMP' (if available) to divide work over multiple processors
ensures high performance when simulating a sample outcome. One of our
design goals was to make the package extendable and enable usage of
the numerical solvers from other R extension packages in order to
facilitate complex epidemiological research. The package contains
template models and can be extended with user-defined models.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `SimInf` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SimInf)

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("SimInf")
```

or use the `remotes` package to install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/stewid/SimInf)

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_github("stewid/SimInf")
```

We refer to section 3.1 in the
[vignette](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SimInf/vignettes/SimInf.pdf)
for detailed installation instructions.
