# SimInf

The package provides an efficient and very flexible framework to
conduct data-driven epidemiological modeling in realistic large scale
disease spread simulations. The framework integrates infection
dynamics in subpopulations as continuous-time Markov chains using the
Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm and incorporates available
data such as births, deaths and movements as scheduled events at
predefined time-points. Using C code for the numerical solvers and
'OpenMP' (if available) to divide work over multiple processors
ensures high performance when simulating a sample outcome. One of our
design goals was to make the package extendable and enable usage of
the numerical solvers from other R extension packages in order to
facilitate complex epidemiological research. The package contains
template models and can be extended with user-defined models.

## Getting started

You can use one of the predefined compartment models in SimInf, for
example, SEIR. But you can also define a custom model 'on the fly'
using the model parser method `mparse`. The method takes a character
vector of transitions in the form of `X -> propensity -> Y` and
automatically generates the C and R code for the model. The left hand
side of the first arrow (`->`) is the initial state, the right hand
side of the last arrow (`->`) is the final state, and the propensity
is written between the two arrows. The flexibility of the `mparse`
approach allows for quick prototyping of new models or features. To
illustrate the `mparse` functionality, let us consider the SIR model
in a closed population i.e., no births or deaths. Let `beta` denote
the transmission rate of spread between a susceptible individual and
an infectious individual and `gamma` the recovery rate from infection
(`gamma` = 1 / average duration of infection). It is also possible to
define variables which can then be used in calculations of
propensities or in calculations of other variables. A variable is
defined by the operator `<-`. Using a variable for the size of the
population, the SIR model can be described as:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(SimInf)

transitions <- c("S -> beta*S*I/N -> I",
                 "I -> gamma*I -> R",
                 "N <- S+I+R")
compartments <- c("S", "I", "R")
```

The `transitions` and `compartments` variables together with the
constants `beta` and `gamma` can now be used to generate a model with
`mparse`. The model also needs to be initialised with the initial
condition `u0` and `tspan`, a vector of time points where the state of
the system is to be returned. Let us create a model that consists of
1000 replicates of a population, denoted a *node* in SimInf, that each
starts with 99 susceptibles, 5 infected and 0 recovered individuals.

```{r}
n <- 1000
u0 <- data.frame(S = rep(99, n), I = rep(5, n), R = rep(0, n))

model <- mparse(transitions = transitions,
                compartments = compartments,
                gdata = c(beta = 0.16, gamma = 0.077),
                u0 = u0,
                tspan = 1:150)
```

To generate data from the model and then print some basic information
about the outcome, run the following commands:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
## For reproducibility of the example, set the seed and
## the number of threads to use for the simulation.
set.seed(123)
set_num_threads(1)
```

```{r}
result <- run(model)
result
```

There are several functions in SimInf to facilitate analysis and
post-processing of simulated data, for example, `trajectory`,
`prevalence` and `plot`. The default `plot` will display the median
count in each compartment across nodes as a colored line together with
the inter-quartile range using the same color, but with transparency.

```{r mparse-SIR, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
plot(result)
```

Most modeling and simulation studies require custom data analysis once
the simulation data has been generated.  To support this, SimInf
provides the `trajectory` method to obtain a `data.frame` with the
number of individuals in each compartment at the time points specified
in `tspan`. Below is the first 10 lines of the `data.frame` with
simulated data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trajectory(result)
```

```
#>    node time  S I R
#> 1     1    1 98 6 0
#> 2     2    1 98 6 0
#> 3     3    1 98 6 0
#> 4     4    1 99 5 0
#> 5     5    1 97 7 0
#> 6     6    1 98 5 1
#> 7     7    1 99 5 0
#> 8     8    1 99 5 0
#> 9     9    1 97 7 0
#> 10   10    1 97 6 1
...
```

Finally, let us use the `prevalence` method to explore the proportion
of infected individuals across all nodes. It takes a model object and
a formula specification, where the left hand side of the formula
specifies the compartments representing cases i.e., have an attribute
or a disease and the right hand side of the formula specifies the
compartments at risk. Below is the first 10 lines of the `data.frame`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
prevalence(result, I ~ S + I + R)
```

```
#>    time prevalence
#> 1     1 0.05196154
#> 2     2 0.05605769
#> 3     3 0.06059615
#> 4     4 0.06516346
#> 5     5 0.06977885
#> 6     6 0.07390385
#> 7     7 0.07856731
#> 8     8 0.08311538
#> 9     9 0.08794231
#> 10   10 0.09321154
...
