\details{
Example data to initialize scheduled events (see
\code{\linkS4class{SimInf_events}}) for a population of 1600 nodes
and demonstrate the \code{\linkS4class{SIR}} model. The dataset
contains 466692 events for 1600 nodes distributed over 4 * 365
days. The events are divided into three types: \sQuote{Exit}
events remove individuals from the population (n = 182535),
\sQuote{Enter} events add individuals to the population (n =
182685), and \sQuote{External transfer} events move individuals
between nodes in the population (n = 101472). The vignette
contains a detailed description of how scheduled events operate on
a model.

## For reproducibility, call the set.seed() function and specify

## remove the set_num_threads() call.
set.seed(123)
set_num_threads(1)

## Create an 'SIR' model with 1600 nodes and initialize
## it to run over 4*365 days. Add one infected individual
## to the first node.
u0 <- u0_SIR()
u0$I[1] <- 1

             beta   = 0.16,
             gamma  = 0.01)

## Display the number of individuals affected by each event type
## per day.
plot(events(model))

## Run the model to generate a single stochastic trajectory.
result <- run(model)
plot(result)

## Summarize the trajectory. The summary includes the number of
## events by event type.
