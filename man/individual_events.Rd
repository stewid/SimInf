\usage{
individual_events(events)
}
\arguments{
\item{events}{a \code{data.frame} with the columns \code{id}, \code{event},
\code{time}, \code{node}, and \code{dest} to define the events, see
\code{details}.}

\description{
In many countries, individual-based livestock data are collected
to enable contact tracing during disease outbreaks. However, the
livestock databases are not always structured in such a way that
relevant information for disease spread simulations is easily
retrieved. The aim of this function is to facilitate cleaning
livestock event data and prepare it for usage in SimInf.
}
\details{
The argument \code{events} in \code{individual_events} must be a
\code{data.frame} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{id:} an integer or character identifier of the individual.
\item \strong{event:} four event types are supported: \emph{exit},
\emph{enter}, \emph{internal transfer}, and \emph{external
transfer}.  When assigning the events, they can either be
coded as a numerical value or a character string: \emph{exit;}
\code{0} or \code{'exit'}, \emph{enter;} \code{1} or
\code{'enter'}, \emph{internal transfer;} \code{2} or
\code{'intTrans'}, and \emph{external transfer;} \code{3} or
\code{'extTrans'}.
\item \strong{time:} an integer, character, or date (of class \code{Date})
for when the event occured. If it's a character it must be
able to coerce to \code{Date}.
\item \strong{node:} an integer or character identifier of the source node.
\item \strong{dest:} an integer or character identifier of the destination
node for movement events, and 'dest' will be replaced with
\code{NA} for non-movement events.
