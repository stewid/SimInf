Class to handle data for the \code{SimInf_model}.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{G}}{Dependency graph that indicates the transition rates that
need to be updated after a given state transition has occured.
A non-zero entry in element \code{G[i, i]} indicates that
transition rate \code{i} needs to be recalculated if the state
transition \code{j} occurs. Sparse matrix (\eqn{Nt \times Nt})
of object class
\code{\link[Matrix:dgCMatrix-class]{dgCMatrix}}.}

\item{\code{S}}{Each column corresponds to a state transition, and
execution of state transition \code{j} amounts to adding the
\code{S[, j]} column to the state vector \code{u[, i]} of node
\emph{i} where the transition occurred. Sparse matrix (\eqn{Nc
\times Nt}) of object class
\code{\link[Matrix:dgCMatrix-class]{dgCMatrix}}.}

\item{\code{U}}{The result matrix with the number of individuals in each
compartment in every node. \code{U[, j]} contains the number
of individuals in each compartment at
\code{tspan[j]}. \code{U[1:Nc, j]} contains the number of
individuals in node 1 at \code{tspan[j]}. \code{U[(Nc + 1):(2
* Nc), j]} contains the number of individuals in node 2 at
\code{tspan[j]} etc. Integer matrix (\eqn{N_n N_c \times}
\code{length(tspan)}).}

\item{\code{U_sparse}}{If the model was configured to write the solution
to a sparse matrix
(\code{\link[Matrix:dgCMatrix-class]{dgCMatrix}}) the
\code{U_sparse} contains the data and \code{U} is empty. The
layout of the data in \code{U_sparse} is identical to
\code{U}. Please note that \code{U_sparse} is numeric and
\code{U} is integer.}

\item{\code{V}}{The result matrix for the real-valued continuous
state. \code{V[, j]} contains the real-valued state of the
system at \code{tspan[j]}. Numeric matrix
(\eqn{N_n}\code{dim(ldata)[1]} \eqn{\times}
\code{length(tspan)}).}

\item{\code{V_sparse}}{If the model was configured to write the solution
to a sparse matrix
(\code{\link[Matrix:dgCMatrix-class]{dgCMatrix}}) the
\code{V_sparse} contains the data and \code{V} is empty. The
layout of the data in \code{V_sparse} is identical to
\code{V}.}

\item{\code{ldata}}{A matrix with local data for the nodes. The column
\code{ldata[, j]} contains the local data vector for the node
\code{j}. The local data vector is passed as an argument to
the transition rate functions and the post time step function.}

\item{\code{gdata}}{A numeric vector with global data that is common to
all nodes.  The global data vector is passed as an argument to
the transition rate functions and the post time step function.}

\item{\code{tspan}}{A vector of increasing time points where the state of
each node is to be returned.}

\item{\code{u0}}{The initial state vector (\eqn{N_c \times N_n}) with the
number of individuals in each compartment in every node.}

\item{\code{v0}}{The initial value for the real-valued continuous state.
Numeric matrix (\code{dim(ldata)[1]} \eqn{\times N_n}).}

\item{\code{events}}{Scheduled events \code{\linkS4class{SimInf_events}}}

\item{\code{replicates}}{Number of replicates of the model.}

\item{\code{C_code}}{Character vector with optional model C code. If
non-empty, the C code is written to a temporary C-file when
the \code{run} method is called.  The temporary C-file is
compiled and the resulting DLL is dynamically loaded. The DLL
is unloaded and the temporary files are removed after running
the model.}
